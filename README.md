# REACT CLI FOR GENERATING COMPONENTS WITH TEMPLATES

This small React library will help you generate/create your new component!
Command inspired by Angular 'ng generate component'.

It's configurable!

#Install
```npm install -g cli-rct```

```rct g path/to/new/component```

Generates file based on configuration from config.js.
Last part of the path is always the component name. First letter will be uppercased if nescessary.
